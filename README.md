# Analyzing-Financial-Risks-of-Stock-Markets
FIN 654: Financial Analytics

For my Financial coursework, I analyzed stocks of multiple companies using **R Programming**. I plotted different visualization graphs for understanding Financial data. I understood the trends of each company's stocks over a span of 5 years.

**Analysis:**
1. Understood the data by performing descriptive analysis
2. Altered time and date formats
3. Calculated Yearly Excess Returns for each stock
4. Build multiple Time-Series Models of stocks spanning 5 years.
5. Develop Visualizations like Boxplot, Scatter Plots, Histograms, Q-Q Plots
6. Calculating Financial terms like Sharpe Ratio using R
7. Analyzing data using Percentiles
8. Build a correlation matrix to understand variables
9. Build a Linear Model to understand the relationships
10. Build summary statistics for each model
11. Calculating the risk of each stock using Financial techniques
